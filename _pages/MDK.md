Additionally to the C++ software, a model development kit (MDK) was written in MATLAB for comparison
and validation of the integrity of the implemented algorithms. For the MDK the same class structure is
used and the functionalities are limited to simulation of temperature traces using the same heat-transfer models and databases as of the C++ version.
The MDK can be used for testing and developing new models before they are integrated in the LIISim framework.<br><br>
