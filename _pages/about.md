## History
LIISim was so far known as **console application (LIISim 1.5)** and **web interface (www.liisim.com)**, developed by Max Hofmann 
between 2001 and 2007. The console application was written in C and the web interface was based on Perl. 
Modeling settings and file names for experimental data could be defined in DAT files and after execution of the console 
application, DAT output files containing the modeling results are created.         <br>
Later the console application was extended by a C++ based graphical user interface (GUI) by Tobias Terheiden and Martin Leschowski, which allowed the visualization of 
 the modeling results from the DAT files (**LIISim Desktop 1.02** and **LIISim Console 2.14**). While the console application was distributed
 among the community, the desktop version was not published and was only internally used.  <br>
In 2013 the development of **LIISim 3** a new framework with object-oriented structure based on C++ was started by Raphael Mansmann 
designed for the application on individual material systems (soot and non-soot) with a modular implementation of signal 
processing steps and choice of heat-transfer models.
